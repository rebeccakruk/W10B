            <p id="firstPara">The oceans tend to be stratified, the principal factor being temperature; the bottom waters of the deep parts are intensely cold, with temperatures only slightly above freezing. The surface zone, where temperature variations are perceptible, is between 330 and 1,000 feet (100 and 300 metres) thick.</p>

            <h2>The warmest Ocean</h2>
            <p id="warmest">The Indian Ocean has the warmest surface temperature of all the world&#185;s oceans, as most of it is found in the tropics.</p>
            <p class="info">This ocean is bordered by Asia, Africa, and Australia and is the warmest in the world. Water temperatures of the Indian Ocean range between 66 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit (19 to 30 Celsius) on the oceanâ€™s upper layer. Since it does not connect to the Arctic Ocean, the coldest ocean on Earth, the Indian Ocean stays pretty warm all year round. The warm waters help foster marine life and, because of this, commercial fishing expeditions are popular.</p>
